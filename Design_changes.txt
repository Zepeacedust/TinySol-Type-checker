# Short description of design changes

## changes in types
types are represented as a tuple of (data_type, security level)

## changes in language
Add some changes in statement rules.

Stm -> set L:= e
Stm -> call e_1.f(e~):e_2,

this means that every statement starts with a specific keyword, vastly reducing ambiguity.
