# Short description of design changes

## changes in types
types are represented as a tuple of (data_type, security level)

## changes in language
Add some changes in statement rules.

Stm -> set L:= e
Stm -> call e_1.f(e~):e_2,

this means that every statement starts with a specific keyword, vastly reducing ambiguity.

## Added a print statement
added print EXPRESSION, it is not typed since it is only intended for debugging

## Added lists
unary -> [Parameter]
Parameter -> EXPRESSION
Parameter -> Parameter, EXPRESSION

all parameters must be able to be subtyped together.

unary -> unary [ EXPRESSION ]
expression must be integer

## Added unsafe statements

stmt -> unsafe stmt

just don't type check it, will still execute.

## explicit inheritance
change interface definition to be 
interface NAME extends NAME {

}
